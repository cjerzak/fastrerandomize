\title{Calculate Vectorized Hotelling's T² Statistic}
\usage{
VectorizedFastHotel2T2(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{samp_}{A JAX array containing the covariate data matrix}

\item{w_}{A JAX array containing the treatment assignment vector (1 for treated, 0 for control)}

\item{n0}{Number of control units}

\item{n1}{Number of treated units}
}
\value{
A JAX array containing Hotelling's T² statistic for each sample
}
\description{
Computes a vectorized version of Hotelling's T² statistic to measure multivariate balance 
between treatment and control groups. This function utilizes JAX's vectorization capabilities 
for efficient computation across multiple samples.
}
\details{
The function computes Hotelling's T² statistic using the following steps:
1. Calculates means for treatment and control groups
2. Computes pooled covariance matrix
3. Calculates T² = (x̄₁ - x̄₀)ᵀ Σ⁻¹ (x̄₁ - x̄₀)

Uses diagonal covariance matrix for GPU compatibility.
