\title{Draws a random sample of acceptable randomizations from all possible complete randomizations using Monte Carlo sampling}
\usage{
generate_randomizations_mc(
  n_units,
  n_treated,
  X,
  randomization_accept_prob = 1,
  threshold_func = VectorizedFastHotel2T2,
  max_draws = 1e+05,
  batch_size = 1000,

}
\arguments{
\item{n_units}{An integer specifying the total number of experimental units}

\item{n_treated}{An integer specifying the number of units to be assigned to treatment}

\item{X}{A numeric matrix of covariates used for balance checking. Cannot be NULL.}

\item{randomization_accept_prob}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the probability threshold for accepting randomizations based on balance. Default is 1}

\item{threshold_func}{A JAX function that computes a balance measure for each randomization. Must be vectorized using jax$vmap with in_axes = list(NULL, 0L, NULL, NULL), and inputs covariates (matrix of X), treatment_assignment (vector of 0s and 1s), n0 (scalar), n1 (scalar). Default is VectorizedFastHotel2T2 which uses Hotelling's T^2 statistic}

\item{max_draws}{An integer specifying the maximum number of randomizations to draw. Default is 100000}

\item{batch_size}{An integer specifying how many randomizations to process at once. Default is 10000. Lower values use less memory but may be slower}

\item{seed}{An integer seed for random number generation. Default is 42}

\item{approximate_inv}{A logical value indicating whether to use an approximate inverse
(diagonal of the covariance matrix) instead of the full matrix inverse when computing
balance metrics. This can speed up computations for high-dimensional covariates.
Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{verbose}{A logical value indicating whether to print detailed information about batch processing progress, and GPU memory usage. Default is FALSE}

\item{file}{A character string specifying the path (including filename) where candidate
randomizations will be saved. If \code{NULL}, the function returns the randomizations
in memory. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{conda_env}{A character string specifying the name of the conda environment to use
via \code{reticulate}. Default is "fastrerandomize".}

\item{conda_env_required}{A logical indicating whether the specified conda environment
must be strictly used. If \code{TRUE}, an error is thrown if the environment is not found.
Default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A JAX array containing the accepted randomizations, where each row represents one possible treatment assignment vector
}
\description{
This function performs sampling with replacement to generate randomizations in a memory-efficient way.
It processes randomizations in batches to avoid memory issues and filters them based on covariate balance.
The function uses JAX for fast computation and memory management.
}
\details{
The function works by:
\enumerate{
\item Generating batches of random permutations using JAX's random permutation functionality
\item Computing balance measures for each permutation using the provided threshold function
\item Keeping only the top permutations that meet the acceptance probability threshold
\item Managing memory by clearing unused objects and JAX caches between batches
}

The function uses smaller data types (int8, float16) where possible to reduce memory usage.
It also includes assertions to verify array shapes and dimensions throughout.
